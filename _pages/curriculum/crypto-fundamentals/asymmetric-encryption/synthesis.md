# Synthesis

The most amazing part about asymmetric encryption is that it all boils down to this.  TLS/HTTPS, S/MIME, x509 certificates, PGP - these are all broadly using the same toolkits.  There absolutely are important implementation differences, and they all also use symmetric encryption as part of their process - but fundamentally, they use asymmetric, public/private key exchange, as the core part of how they work.  

* PGP
* TLS 
* S/MIME
* PKI / x509

## If asymmetric crypto is so cool, what about symmetric crypto?

* limits of RSA
* layering of symmetric keys inside asymetric systems - PGP! 

## Beyond RSA



## But What About Quantum?

(Martijn's piece?)
