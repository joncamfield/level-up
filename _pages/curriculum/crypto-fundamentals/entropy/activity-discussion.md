# Materials to Prepare

This activity requires no materials or preparations, scales well, and works mostly well across cultural boundaries. 

# Running the Activity

In pairs, take turns making guesses about features of the city that your partner lives in or close to. Try to make guesses that are "simple" enough that you can get at least 10 guesses in a row correct -- consider starting with something like "Does your city have at least one street in it?"

Try for as many guesses as you can in the time allotted, call out for every cumulative 10 right guesses in a row you get.

# Leading the Discussion

* How many correct guesses were you able to get to?
* Why was is easy to get so many correct guesses?
* While we often think about cities as big, messy chaotic places - perhaps they share more order than it seems?
