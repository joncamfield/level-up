title: Entropy and Password Security
summary: Entropy is the measure of randomness, and it is exactly the randomness of passwords that gives them strength. Importantly, though, that does not have to come from impossible to remember jumbles of complex characters (though it certainly can!). This topic should help expose the nuance around password complexity conversations, as well as explain some of the weirder rough edges of security tools (like having to move your mouse around randomly to set up veracrypt drives).
