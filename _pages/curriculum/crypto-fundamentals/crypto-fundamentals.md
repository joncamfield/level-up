title: Fundamentals of Cryptography
author: Jon Camfield
summary: "This section contains advanced training modules for trainings of trainers and technical users. 

	The tools and practices of digital safety stands on top of a relatively small amount of core cryptographic concepts.  Often in training on tools and practices, we treat the cryptography as magic that we just trust inherently, or use a metaphor and move on. For those who shoulder the responsibility of training others on digital safety, however, it is critical we make an effort to more deeply understand these concepts, and understand where our knowledge thins out and stops, so that we can be honest with ourselves and those we support when we get complex questions."
