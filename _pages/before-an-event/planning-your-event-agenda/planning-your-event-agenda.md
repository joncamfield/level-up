#### Make sure you allot yourself enough time for crafting an agenda as well the preparation that follows. The more days there are for the workshop, the more prep days you'll need. 

Next to figuring out your individual Topics and learning objectives (see [related article](https://www.securityeducationcompanion.org/articles/learning-objectives) from the Security Education Companion), overall session agenda planning is the probably the most important activity you can spend time on before you get into the classroom. Since many events will require trainers to tweak agendas based on unknown or unforeseen circumstances, thoughtful and thorough pre-event preparation will help you make last-minute adjustments, especially if you're prepared for a second set of potential training sessions.

The decisions in the process of [Planning Your Training Event](/before-an-event/planning-your-training-event/) will become input parameters for the process of designing your agenda. To present this guidance as helpfully as possible, we've broken this resource down into several main sections that can be used as planning aids for workshops:

### 1. [The Participant Driven Agenda](/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/the-participant-driven-agenda/)
While there are certain minimums and limitations that should be observed in order for an event to be a successful one, in general participants should be given as much control of the agenda as possible.

### 2. [Agenda Checklist](/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/agenda-checklist/)
While technical event content is frequently the easiest place to begin when organizing a comprehensive agenda, there are many other components which must also be planned and prepared. To help trainers and facilitators keep track of all these moving pieces, we've organized an Agenda Checklist.

### 3. [Trainer Coordination Checklist](/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/trainer-coordination-checklist/)
Planning for an event agenda doesn't end with finalizing its design and content - there is a whole series of activities and preparation that must also be in place 'behind the scenes' in order to run a successful event and agenda. To help trainers and facilitators keep track of all these moving pieces, we've also organized a Trainer Coordination Checklist.
